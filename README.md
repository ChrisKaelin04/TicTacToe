This is a very basic TicTacToe implementation I hope you enjoy.

Player (you) is always X. Click any box to start, normal rules.
The AI (basic miniMax) is O. It is trying to beat you or draw.

This is written in CPP on c++Builder. I did this to better understand some aspects
of CPP and the minimax algorithm in use.

Currently no method of restarting the game without closing and opening the exe.
I will fix that later.
